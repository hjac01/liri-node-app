# liri-node-app


Liri allows users to find a concert for a specific artist, find a song they are thinking of, find a movie, and see the FS NPM Package in action. 

With each of the following commands, the user will receive an appropriate output: 
   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`
   
   
   For example, in the command line, a user may type the following: 
              
              node liri.js concert-this beyonce
              
   The user would then receive information regarding upcoming Beyonce performances. 
   
   This formula may be followed for all command line arguments with to the same effect.
